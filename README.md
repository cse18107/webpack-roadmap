## 🟢 Stage 1: Junior Level – Webpack Basics

### 📚 Core Concepts

- [ ] Asset management (images, fonts, CSS)
- [ ] Source maps
- [ ] `webpack-dev-server`

### 🛠 Projects
- [ ] Set up a basic React app from scratch with Webpack
- [ ] Manually configure Babel + Webpack
- [ ] Add support for CSS and images

---

## 🟡 Stage 2: Mid-Level – Intermediate Webpack & Ecosystem

### 🔍 In-Depth Concepts
- [ ] Loaders vs Plugins (internally)
- [ ] Tree shaking
- [ ] Code splitting (`SplitChunksPlugin`, dynamic `import()`)
- [ ] Caching strategies
- [ ] Dev vs Prod config
- [ ] Environment variables

### ✅ Skills to Learn
- [ ] Advanced Babel setup
- [ ] Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- [ ] Multi-config setup (`webpack.common.js`, `dev.js`, `prod.js`)

## 🔵 Stage 3: Advanced – Production-Grade Webpack

### 🧠 Master Concepts
- [ ] Custom loaders and plugins (write your own)
- [ ] DLLPlugin & Module Federation
- [ ] Lazy loading & prefetch/preload
- [ ] SSR basics with Webpack
- [ ] Performance tuning for large apps

### ✅ Skills to Learn
- [ ] Write a custom Webpack plugin
- [ ] Write a custom loader
- [ ] Explore Webpack internal hook system
- [ ] Use `contenthash`, `chunkhash` for caching
- [ ] Use `--profile` and `stats.json` for performance audits

### 🛠 Projects
- [ ] Build a micro-frontend app with Webpack Module Federation
- [ ] Publish a custom Webpack loader/plugin
- [ ] Configure SSR manually for a React app

---

## 🔴 Stage 4: Expert – Webpack with React & Next.js

### 🧩 Framework Integration
- [ ] Understand CRA Webpack abstraction
- [ ] Customize CRA with `craco` or `react-app-rewired`
- [ ] Deep dive into Next.js Webpack usage
- [ ] Modify Webpack in `next.config.js`

### ✅ Skills to Learn
- [ ] Customize Webpack/Babel in CRA and Next.js
- [ ] Use Next.js Webpack 5 features (e.g., Module Federation)
- [ ] Set up a monorepo with shared Webpack config
- [ ] Understand TurboPack and compare with Webpack

### 🛠 Projects
- [ ] Customize a Next.js Webpack build (CSS, Babel, plugins)
- [ ] Build a monorepo with shared UI packages
- [ ] Replace CRA with custom Webpack config

---

## 🧠 Final Goal – Top 1% Senior Knowledge

### 🎯 Mastery Indicators
- [ ] Debug performance bottlenecks with profiling tools
- [ ] Optimize huge builds for enterprise teams
- [ ] Choose the right bundler (Webpack, Vite, esbuild, TurboPack)
- [ ] Contribute to Webpack or Next.js OSS
- [ ] Mentor devs in build tooling best practices
